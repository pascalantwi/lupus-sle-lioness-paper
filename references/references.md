# References

<!-- The project's reference list. This project keeps no Zotero library: this file is the only source
for anything cited in a deliverable from the proposal onward (workflow/rules.md, section 2).

- The agent writes each entry from a record it opened (the DOI's Crossref record or the publisher's
  page, PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, CRAN or Bioconductor for software) and names that record, with the
  date, in the `record` field. Nothing is written from memory.
- `references.bib` is generated from this file by
  `python3 -I manuscript/build-bib.py references/references.md manuscript/references.bib --citations manuscript/citations.csv`
  and is never edited by hand. Faults go to `reference-fixes.md`.
- The quoted line under each heading is rewritten by build-bib.py on every run: edit the fields, not
  the quoted line.
- The passage each citation rests on is recorded in `citations.csv`, not here.
- `full_text` says where the full text was read: a URL (an open copy), `references/pdfs/<key>.pdf`
  (a PDF the user added; the folder is git-ignored), `abstract only` (allowed for a supporting
  citation), or `pending` (a core citation still waiting for its full text).
- The user reviews this file once, at the end (workflow/03-manuscript.md, step 6, the reference review).

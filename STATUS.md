## Stage record

One line per stage boundary, newest last: the date, the stage reached, the path of the deliverable the user reads, and the stop that is open. The agent writes the line when it reaches a stop; the user's answer is the next message in the conversation, and the agent records the decision in the stage's log.

| Date | Stage | Deliverable | Open stop |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-11-13 | 1, proposal final (stop 1 waived by the user) | `proposal.md` | none |
| 2026-11-13 | 2, piloted-close-call | `pilot/pilot-report.html` | stage 2 stop: the user reads the close call |
| 2026-11-13 | 2, piloted-close-call; revision 1 written | `proposal.md`, section 12 | revision stop: the user approves the three aims and pilot-b's rule |
